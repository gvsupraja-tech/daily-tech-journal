Day 3: Blockchain
This is Day 3 of my daily tech learning journey on futuristic technologies.

What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital ledger— like a notebook where you store data — but the special part is:

✅ The data is stored in blocks 
✅ The blocks are connected in a chain 
✅ It is decentralized (no single owner like a bank)  
✅ It's very secure and tamper-proof

Easy Example:

Let’s say 3 people want to record their payments:
- A pays B → stored in Block 1  
- B pays C → stored in Block 2  
- C pays A → stored in Block 3

Now all 3 transactions are connected in a chain.  
If someone tries to change Block 1, the whole chain becomes invalid! That’s why it’s secure.

Why Blockchain is Powerful:

-  Transparent — everyone can see the data  
-  Secure — data cannot be easily changed  
-  Decentralized — no middleman (like a bank)

Real World Use Cases

- Cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Voting systems — no tampering  
- Supply chain tracking — see where products come from  
- Smart contracts — auto agreements without humans

--> What I Understood:-

> Blockchain is like a shared notebook. Everyone gets a copy, and once something is written, no one can secretly change it.

Simple Terms

| Word         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Block        | A group of records or data |
| Chain        | Links all blocks securely |
| Decentralized | No single owner; shared among users |
| Immutable    | Cannot be changed once added |
| Smart Contract | Code that runs automatically on blockchain |
