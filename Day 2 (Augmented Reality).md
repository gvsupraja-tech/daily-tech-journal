Day 2: Augmented Reality 
This is Day 2 of my daily tech learning journey on futuristic technologies.

 What is Augmented Reality?
Augmented Reality (AR) adds digital elements — like 3D models, animations, or labels — on top of the real world, in real time.

- You point your phone at the real world
- It shows digital things as if they exist around you

Simple Examples

- Snapchat or Instagram filters that add effects to your face
- Pokémon Go – digital characters appear in your real street
- IKEA app – you place furniture in your room virtually
- Google Lens – scan and identify objects with extra info

Key Concepts

- AR = Real World + Digital Overlay  
- VR = Fully Virtual World  
- MR = Mix of Real and Virtual (interactive)

Like playing with stickers:
- In AR: Your camera is open, and it sticks digital thingsonto your surroundings  
- It happens live, not in a pre-recorded video  
- You move your phone → the digital object moves too!

What I Understood

- AR doesn't replace reality — it enhances it
- It’s already used in games, shopping, education, medicine!
- You don’t need to be an expert to start — tools make it easy

Simple Difference

- AR – Adds to reality  
- VR – Replaces reality  
- MR– Mixes both
