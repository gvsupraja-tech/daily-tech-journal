Day 1: Quantum Computing (Beginner-Friendly)
This is Day 1 of my daily tech learning journey on futuristic technologies.
Quantum computers use qubits instead of regular bits.
- A normal bit can be 0 or 1.
- A qubit can be 0, 1, or both at the same time (this is called superposition).
- When you "check" a qubit (called measurement), it gives either 0 or 1 randomly.
- This makes quantum computers powerful for things like:
  - Weather predictions
  - Medical simulations
  - Password cracking
Simple Example I Used

Like tossing a coin:
- Before it lands: it's like both heads and tails (superposition)
- After it lands: it’s either heads or tails (measured value)

Same with a qubit:
- Before checking → both 0 and 1
- After checking → either 0 or 1
